- C0.M2 Mission state handoff validation: ready.

## 2026-05-21T03:38:23Z - C0.M1 Codex mission harness

- Status: completed
- Summary: Installed Codex-native mission/campaign state, project plan, local
  review roles, `unboundos-go` skill, status/mission/verify scripts, and
  documentation path reconciliation. Installed the pinned Rust toolchain,
  repaired user-local tool discovery, and cleared mechanical fmt/clippy/custom
  target blockers so full fidelity can run.
- Verification: `python3 scripts/status.py`,
  `python3 scripts/mission.py validate`,
  `python3 scripts/verify.py --mission current --dry-run`,
  `python3 scripts/verify.py --mission current`, and
  `env PATH=/home/leah/.cargo/bin:$PATH make fidelity`.
- Blockers: none.
